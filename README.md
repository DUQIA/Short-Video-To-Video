**‚ö†Ô∏èAttention**
- Currently, only one person‚Äôs voice is supported!
-  The currently referenced space is up to one hour. [![huggingface](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97-Open%20in%20Spacce-grue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/whisper-large-v3)
-  If the original video is DTS, then the Vocals audio on the page can only be used as a reference!
-  Currently, only Google translator is supported. If you need other `Translator`, first select the `Translator` and submit. You will get `Language has been reloaded, please select again!` Then, select the `Language`. Click [here](#use-other-translators) for details.

**‚≠ïThe two slowest steps in the current process:**
- Video being recognized as DTS.
- Sending to Whisper.

# üåêUse other translators:
- In the `translates` variable of [list_dict](huggingface/list_dict.py)Ôºåfind the corresponding Translator, and change `None` to the `variate_name` in the `.py` file you created.
- And add `from you_flie_name import variate_name` at the top of [list_dict](huggingface/list_dict.py).
- Add the following code in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run it step by step.
- `!pip install translators` install
- `import translators as ts` import
- `Language_list = ts.translate_text('text', translator='translators', from_language='auto', to_language=None)`Replace 'translators' with the key corresponding to the value you set in [list_dict](huggingface/list_dict.py), this will result in a `TranslatorError` exception, which contains a complete list of this translator, copy it.
- Replace the empty `dict_values` list in the following code.
- ‚ö†Ô∏èNote, most codes are supported in the `url`.If you can‚Äôt find the code in the second line of the printout, you can try [ISO-639-2](https://support.isan.org/hc/en-us/articles/360012734159-List-of-ISO-639-2-Language-Codes), or ask GPT or Copilot.üéâ
```
import bs4
import requests

url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes#Table'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

dict_values = []
dict_keys = []
for x in dict_values:
  id = soup.select(f'#{x}')
  if id:
    vl = id[0].get_text()
    dict_keys.append(vl)
  else:
    dict_keys.append('none')

dicts = dict(zip(dict_keys, dict_values))
print(dicts)
print(dicts['none'])
```
